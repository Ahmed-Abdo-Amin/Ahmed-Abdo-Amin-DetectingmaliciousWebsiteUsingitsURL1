## PROBLEM DEFINITION:

Nowadays internet is a critical life need like food and water and we cannot imagine our life without the internet because our all knowledge, activities, works, memories, history, and lifestyles are the main components of the internet so we must secure it to avoid the destruction for our life. One of the main challenges in internet security is malicious websites because we cannot identify whether they are malicious or not without logging into them, so in our project, we will work on detecting malicious websites via their URLs.
